This is a college project that has been created by Hugh Gill
The Application allows user to make call and texts
It also allows users to receive phone calls and texts
The Application also can veify where numbers are from
and if it suspects links in the incoming text it blocks out the text to the user
The verify number part of the application has yet to be implmented yet but the code is there to implement this in the application
The purpose of this project was to help users identify vishing and smishing attacks
This was because in the modern era smishing and vishing attacks have become a real world problem, because not everybody knows about them, the application is to give people that don't know much about the attacks to be alerted when there is a suspected attempt from numbers from a suspect location or if there maybe something malicious imbedded within the context of a SMS message.
