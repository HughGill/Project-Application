This is a college project that has been created by Hugh Gill
The Application allows user to make call and texts
It also allows users to receive phone calls and texts
The Application also can veify where numbers are from
and if it suspects links in the incoming text it blocks out the text to the user
the 2 latter have yet to be implmented yet but the code is there to implement this in the application
The purpose of this project was to help users identify vishing and smishing attacks
This wsa because in the modern era Smsihing and vishing has become a real worl problem.
